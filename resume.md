## Miscellaneous
References can be provided upon request.
As mentioned above, I'm only open to engineering work that is either:

- fully remote, or
- hybrid (meaning no more than 16 in-person hours per week) and located in Cascadia (Oregon or Washington state).

I'm also *not* open to work in the war industry or fossil-fuels industry.
Please do not contact me about roles that fail any of these criteria.

I'm most interested in design engineering, ideally optomechanical design (though the sub-field isn't a hard requirement).
I work very well with scientists and other engineering disciplines (especially electrical engineers).
I perform best with minimal oversight.
In my ideal workflow, I spend one to two consecutive days coordinating with team members, 
and three to four consecutive days hyperfocusing on the tasks identified by that coordination.
