\begin{letter}{SpaceX Manufacturing and Production}
\opening{Dear Sir or Madam,}

I believe my skills and experience match those requested in your posting for a composites manufacturing engineer. 
%In addition to degrees in mechanical engineering and physics, I have specific skills relevant to your needs.

While leading the composite rocket airframe and cubesat structure projects for the Portland State Aerospace Society, I have: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item refined prototypes and conceptual designs into reliable, reproducible manufacturing procedures;
	\item designed and manufactured composite parts using prepreg and wet-layup systems;
	%\item verified airframe characteristics using simulations in C++ (OpenFOAM);
	%\item written, revised, and fulfilled various subsystem requirements for our rocket and cubesat projects;
	%\item taken projects from loose design constraints to tested, flyable parts and procedures;
	\item designed procedures and tooling to reduce production time and part defects;
	\item written technical procedures for other engineers, informational posters for the general public, and a \href{http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2016-5365}{conference paper};
	%\item prototyped designs using CNC mills, 3D printers, laser cutters, and hand-laid composites;
	\item directed projects for the rocket and cubesat, collaborating between engineering disciplines and mentoring younger students.
\end{itemize}
%I use a Linux environment on a daily basis and am proficient in MATLAB, Python, and R.

Feel free to contact Andrew Greenberg (\href{mailto:adg@ece.pdx.edu}{adg@ece.pdx.edu}) or Erin Schmidt (\href{mailto:esch2@pdx.edu}{esch2@pdx.edu}) as references. 

I'm eager to contribute to the aerospace industry and increase the accessibility of space, so thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your response. 

\closing{Sincerely,\\ Joe Shields}
